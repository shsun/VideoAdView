                    GUIPlayerView implements a simple video player using AVPlayer.

                    To use it, you must create a GUIPlayerView object and add it as a subview to your desired view.
                    Then set the property `videoURL` and call `prepareAndPlayAutomatically:`.

                    If you decide not to play automatically, you can leave for the user to press Play, or you can do it programmatically by calling `play`.

                    Once you're done playing the video, you may want to remove it from your view. To do so, just call the method `clean` and everything will be released, and the player view will be removed from its superview.

                    There are several optional delegate methods you can use:

                    * `- (void)playerDidPause;`
                    * `- (void)playerDidResume;`
                    * `- (void)playerDidEndPlaying;`
                    * `- (void)playerWillEnterFullscreen;`
                    * `- (void)playerDidEnterFullscreen;`
                    * `- (void)playerWillLeaveFullscreen;`
                    * `- (void)playerDidLeaveFullscreen;`
                    * `- (void)playerFailedToPlayToEnd;`
                    * `- (void)playerStalled;`
                    DESC

end
